					I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to everyone who has supported
					me in various ways - through prayers, financial contributions,
					spreading the word, or any other form of support. Every gesture, big
					or small, has made a significant impact, and I'm extremely thankful
					for each one of you.
				</p>

				<p className='mb-6'>
					You have been a blessing, a ray of hope, and a source of motivation
					during these painful and dark times. Your kindness and support have
					touched my heart in ways that words cannot adequately express.
				</p>

				<p className='mb-6'>
					I pray to God that all of you are blessed abundantly, just as you have
					been a blessing to me. Thank you so, so much. May God bless you all.
				</p>

				<p className='mb-6'>
					This is not the end of my journey; it's just a chapter. Please
					continue to keep me in your prayers. I believe in healing, and with
					your continued support, I'll overcome these challenges.
				</p>

				<p>
					Thank you from the depths of my heart.
