					Current Status and Treatment
				</h2>
				<p>
					As we journey through this challenging phase, I want to provide you
					with an update on Rhonak's current status and treatment. His
					creatinine level now stands at a staggering 16.5, and his hemoglobin
					levels have dipped.
				</p>
				<p>
					We've taken a significant step by registering for a kidney transplant,
					although finding a suitable donor is a painstaking process. In the
					meantime, Rhonak continues to endure dialysis three times a week.
					These sessions are not just treatments; they are lifelines, sustaining
					a life his damaged kidneys can no longer support.
				</p>
				<p>
					Under the care of Dr. Ragvaendra Nayak and his dedicated team at AJ
					Hospital, Rhonak continues to fight. This journey is marked by
					heartbreak and sadness, but it's also defined by resilience and
					unwavering hope.
				</p>
				<p>
					With your support, Rhonak fights not just to survive but to thrive.
					Your presence in this journey keeps his hopes alive and his
					determination unbroken.
